# 🛠️ Phase 1: Tier 1 Implementation Tasks – *GreatShield*

This checklist outlines all required development tasks to complete Tier 1 of the GreatShield extension.

---

## ✅ Phase Objectives

- Establish a functional scanning pipeline for browser-based document protection.
- Ensure safe document types are allowed and suspicious ones are blocked.
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage across units and flows.
- Enable users to receive instant feedback with toast notifications.

---

## 1. Type Definitions

- [ ] Define `DownloadEvent`, `Policy`, `AnalysisResult`, `ScanVerdict` in `src/types/interfaces.ts`
- [ ] Create `PopupDisplayPayload`, `RuleMatch` types
- [ ] Set up shared `models.ts` for internal use across modules

---

## 2. Utility Module Implementation

- [ ] `logger.ts` – info/error logging wrapper
- [ ] `configManager.ts` – load & manage policy config
- [ ] `storage.ts` – IndexedDB abstraction for caching
- [ ] `fileTypes.ts` – allowed extension registry and helpers

---

## 3. Core Components

- [ ] `serviceWorker.ts` – listens for download events
- [ ] `eventBus.ts` – dispatch/download pipeline orchestration
- [ ] `downloadScanner.ts` – coordinates scanning logic
- [ ] `policyEnforcer.ts` – filters invalid files
- [ ] `fileAnalyzer.ts` – parses file and computes hash
- [ ] `ruleEngine.ts` – applies static rules (regex matches)
- [ ] `notificationManager.ts` – shows toast + handles popup trigger
- [ ] `smartScanGateway.ts` – stubbed async handler for Tier 2

---

## 4. Integration & Workflow

- [ ] Connect event → scan → notify flow via `eventBus`
- [ ] Add caching logic for previously scanned files
- [ ] Ensure skipped files (unsupported/oversized) are handled gracefully

---

## 5. Popup UI

- [ ] Implement popup page with scan result summary
- [ ] Display file name, verdict, matched rules, timestamp

---

## 6. Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for `PolicyEnforcer`, `RuleEngine`, `FileAnalyzer`, etc. (Jest)
- [ ] E2E tests for real download-to-notification flow (Playwright)
- [ ] Mock malicious/clean file fixtures in `tests/assets/`

---

## 7. CI/CD Pipeline

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions (lint, type-check, test, build)
- [ ] Ensure coverage badge updates
- [ ] Ensure build outputs to `dist/`

---

## 8. Performance Benchmarks

- [ ] Measure average scan latency (goal: < 50ms)
- [ ] Measure memory footprint (goal: < 5MB idle)

---

## 9. Documentation

- [ ] Ensure all TypeScript interfaces are documented in `docs/interface-reference.md`
- [ ] Link module descriptions in `architecture.md`
